Purpose
•	Brainstorm and gather all the ideas from three of us
•	Have a discussion on the ideas and choose the best one
•	Add necessary details to our GWAP project
Progress Update
Ideas we got: 
1.	Use crowd wisdom and collective intelligence to build a game that allows people to make prediction on things that will happen shortly. For example, in tomorrow’s NBA match, which team will win? Rockets or Celtics? Players simply choose the right answers that they think are most likely to be right.
2.	Indoor geospatial tagging system: in such geotagging games, for instance, a user who has been to a restaurant inside some indoor shopping centre and becomes quite familiar with its environment and menu can tag it with its location, pictures, menu information and so on. It would be of great help that other customers who might want to visit this restaurant can get insight into it and make their decision.
3.	An online system that allows players to answer questions by simply judging whether the statements are right or wrong. And all the questions are related to energy conservation problems. For example, let the players to judge whether a common filament lamp for daily use will consume more than 2 kWh a day or not. We can also allow users to login with Facebook accounts so that they can play against their friends and check the leaderboard of different categories related to these questions. Besides, the results can be analysed in many useful ways. We will probably find most people usually underestimate the consumption of the electrical devices, which suggests that the manufacturer should indicate the products with the amount of electricity consumption more clearly and intuitively(This is the subject we decide to use).
Actions & Repsonsibilities
•	We all have been brainstorming the ideas in the last few days. And discuss them together. (CX, XZ, LY)
•	Come up with some initial questions for the system, and decide a way to present the system (ppt, html or some other ways). (CX, XZ)
•	Come up with the details of the game and try to think out some fun parts to entertain the players. Also give some basic rules of score calculation and so on. (CX, LY)
•	Come up with some ways to deal with the answers we will get from the user. What we can do with them to draw different conclusions to help the world to save energy. (XZ, LY)
